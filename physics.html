                            <p><strong>Physics</strong> Is science that deals with the structure of matter and the
                                interactions
                                between the
                                fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics

                                submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects

            <h2><u>Motion In one Dimension</u></h2>
            <h3><u>2.1 The Important Stuff</u></h3>
            <h4><u>2.1.1Position,Time and Displacement</u></h4>
            <!--Meaning-->
            <p>We begin our study of motion by considering objects which are very small in comparison to
                the size of their movement through space. When we can deal with an object in this way we
                refer to it as a particle. In this chapter we deal with the case where a particle moves along
                a straight line.
                The particle’s location is specified by its coordinate, which will be denoted by x or y.
                As the particle moves, its coordinate changes with the time, t. The change in position from
                x1 to x2 of the particle is the displacement ∆x, with ∆x = x2 − x1.</p>
            <video controls play src="/imgphysics/video/Position,Time.mp4"></video>

            <h3><u>2.1.2 Average Velocity And Average Speed</u></h3>

            <p>When a particle has a displacement ∆x in a change of time ∆t, its average velocity for
                that time interval is
                v =
                ∆x
                ∆t
                =
                x2 − x1
                t2 − t1
                (2.1)
                The average speed of the particle is absolute value of the average velocity and is given
                by
                s =
                Distance travelled
                ∆t
                (2.2)
                In general, the value of the average velocity for a moving</p>
            <video controls play src="/imgphysics/video/AverageVelociy-speed.mp4"></video>
            <h3><u>2.1.3 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed</u></h3>
            <p>We can answer the question “how fast is a particle moving at a particular time t?” by finding
                the instantaneous velocity. This is the limiting case of the average velocity when the time
                interval ∆t include the time t and is as small as we can imagine:
                v = lim
                ∆t→0
                ∆x
                ∆t
                =
                dx
                dt (2.3)
                The instantaneous speed is the absolute value (magnitude) of the instantaneous velocity.
                If we make a plot of x vs. t for a moving particle the instantaneous velocity is the slope
                of the tangent to the curve at any point.</p>

            <h3><u>2.1.4 Acceleration</u></h3>
            <p>When a particle’s velocity changes, then we way that the particle undergoes an acceleration.
                If a particle’s velocity changes from v1 to v2 during the time interval t1 to t2 then we
                define the average acceleration as
                v =
                ∆x
                ∆t
                =
                x2 − x1
                t2 − t1
                (2.4)
                As with velocity it is usually more important to think about the instantaneous acceleration, given by
                a = lim
                ∆t→0
                ∆v
                ∆t
                =
                dv
                dt (2.5)
                If the acceleration a is positive it means that the velocity is instantaneously increasing;
                if a is negative, then v is instantaneously decreasing. Oftentimes we will encounter the word
                deceleration in a problem. This word is used when the sense of the acceleration is opposite
                that of the instantaneous velocity (the motion). Then the magnitude of acceleration is given,
                with its direction being understood.</p>

            <h1><u>UNIT THREE</u></h1>
            <h2><u>PRESSURE</u></h2>
            <h3><u>2.1 MEASURING ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE</u></h3>
            <p>The atmospheric pressure is the weight exerted by the overhead
                atmosphere on a unit area of surface. It can be measured with a
                mercury barometer, consisting of a long glass tube full of mercury
                inverted over a pool of mercury:
                When the tube is inverted over the pool, mercury flows out of the
                tube, creating a vacuum in the head space, and stabilizes at an
                equilibrium height h over the surface of the pool. This equilibrium
                requires that the pressure exerted on the mercury at two points on
                the horizontal surface of the pool, A (inside the tube) and B (outside
                the tube), be equal. The pressure PA at point A is that of the
                mercury column overhead, while the pressure PB at point B is that
                of the atmosphere overhead. We obtain PA from measurement of h:
                (2.1)
                where ρHg = 13.6 g cm-3 is the density of mercury and g = 9.8 m s-2
                is the acceleration of gravity. The mean value of h measured at sea
                level is 76.0 cm, and the corresponding atmospheric pressure is
                1.013x105 kg m-1 s-2 in SI units. The SI pressure unit is called the
                Pascal (Pa); 1 Pa = 1 kg m-1 s-2. Customary pressure units are the
                atmosphere (atm) (1 atm = 1.013x105 Pa), the bar (b) (1 b = 1x105 Pa),
                the millibar (mb) (1 mb = 100 Pa), and the torr (1 torr = 1 mm Hg =
                134 Pa). The use of millibars is slowly giving way to the equivalent
                SI unit of hectoPascals (hPa). The mean atmospheric pressure at
                sea level is given equivalently as P = 1.013x105 Pa = 1013 hPa =
                1013 mb = 1 atm = 760 torr
